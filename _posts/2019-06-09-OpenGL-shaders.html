<p> 4 combinations of shaders that I wrote as a part of Graphics for Games module each producing a unique effect. The aim of the assignment was to practice writing OpenGL shaders and 
gain a better understanding of how the rendering pipeline works.</p>

<h4> Shrinking</h4>
<p> The displacement of cube vertices is done in vertex shader. Total time is passed as uniform, the larger the value, the closer the vertices are to origin.

</p>

<h4> Transparency</h4>
<p> Additional texture is created which is the same as box texture but instead has some transparent patches. Total time is passed to fragment shader, in which the final colour is a blend of the two textures.

</p>

<h4> Exploding cubes </h4>
<p>
	First, the cube is subdivided using a tesselation shader. Then, each newly created vertex is replaced with a small textured cube - this is done in geometry shader. The positions are initially normalized and slowly return to their original place - 
	this creates an effect of a sphere transforming to a cube.
	The position of smaller cubes is regulated by total time passed and the explosion is masked out by the same texture as in transparency shader.

</p>

<h4> Footprints </h4>
<p> 
	The cube is subdivided using a tesselation shader, same as in Exploding cubes. The C++ program stores an array of Vector3 variables, one for each footstep. When left mouse button is clicked, the screenspace coordinates are mapped to
	texture coordinates of the cube and based on the size of footstep texture, a new colour is calculated. The vertex positions are also offset based on whether the footstep is present on a given patch or not.
