	A simple game that I made during first year of uni. Learned a little about game development, Unity and C#. Besides the gameplay elements, the game included some simple music that I made as well as the models of clowds and the helicopter. The game includes a shop to upgrade the helicopter's speed, number of rockets it launches and the range of firing them. Difficulty gradually increases for all the game modes, however this could have used some tweaking to make it more rewarding.
