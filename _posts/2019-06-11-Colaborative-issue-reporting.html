<p>
	An android app project which was developed during second year in University.
</p>

<p>
	With help of other students, created an android application for a city council which features collaborative issue reporting. The main idea of the app is to allow the council are residents to report issues about the community in the app, tag them on the map (for example a broken bench at some location) and then, whoever controls the database or has access to application can check and resolve the issues. Features that I have worked on exclusively include:
	
	<h4> Issue reporting using Firebase real-time database and Google Maps Api </h4>
<p>
	<video width="270" height="480" controls>
	<source src="{{ 'assets/videos/reporter.webm' | relative_url }}" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 
	
	<video width="270" height="480" controls>
	<source src="{{ 'assets/videos/viewer.webm' | relative_url }}" type="video/ogg">
	</video> 
	</br>
	Video3 resolved issue turns green 
	</br>
	Screenshot of markers database refering users and photos
	
</p>
	<h4> User ranking and rewards </h4>
<p>
	Screenshot database "resolved" property, change it's value.
	</br>
	User rewarded with points, user rewarded again, user gains extra star, star is displayed.
