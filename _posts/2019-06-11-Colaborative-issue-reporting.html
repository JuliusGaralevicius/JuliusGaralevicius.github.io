<p>
	An android app project which was developed during second year in University.
</p>

<p>
	With help of other students, created an android application for a city council which features collaborative issue reporting. The main idea of the app is to allow the council are residents to report issues about the community in the app, tag them on the map (for example a broken bench at some location) and then, whoever controls the database or has access to application can check and resolve the issues. Features that I have worked on exclusively include:
</p>
	<h4> Issue reporting using Firebase real-time database and Google Maps Api </h4>
<p>
	Users can place a marker on the map at the location where the issue exists, attach a photo and a short description. User id and date of posting is then attatched and data is uploaded to the database. The fragment on another phone listens to changes in database and immediately detects when new issue is raised and synchronizes.

<h4> User ranking and rewards </h4>
<p>
	To partially prevent the map from being spammed with markers which have nothing to do with issues (selfies, random photos), I have implemented a user ranking system. Each user starts with 1 star and gets 1 report per day. Users get points from logging in and having their issues resolved. As users get more points, they gain extra stars and can raise more issues.
