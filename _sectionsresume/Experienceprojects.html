		<h4>3D Flocking simulation using GPGPU programming (OpenGL, GLSL, C++)
		<a href="https://github.com/JuliusGaralevicius/3D-flocking" class="icon-b fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a>
		</h4>
		
		<p> Dissertation project. Implemented a standard flocking algorithm on the GPU, later optimised the nearest neighbour search using spatial binning, compared and tested performance. The project aim was to investigate the GPU capabilities using OpenGL Compute Shaders for general particle simulations. Learned about advantages and limitations of GPU compute, implemented a parallel prefix scan and counting sort.</p>
		
		<h4>Game prototype (UE4 Blueprint)
		<a href="https://juliuz.itch.io/castledefender" class="icon fas fa-play-circle"><span class="label">Github</span></a>
		</h4>
		
		<p> A project I have been working on during my free time with purpose of learning techniques of asset creation, AI, gameplay systems using a modern rendering engine. Practiced steps of a modern character creation pipeline â€“ sculpting with zbrush, retopologizing, exporting to 3ds Max for basic texturing and rigging/animating in Maya. Used unreal engine behaviour trees and navmesh for AI combined with state machines for character animation. Blueprints were used for most of the game logic.</p>
		
		<h4>Android demo application for collaborative issue reporting (Java)
		<a href="https://github.com/JuliusGaralevicius/Colaborative_issue_reporting" class="icon-b fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a>
		</h4>
		
		<p> App designed to allow users of a community to raise issues. Uses Firebase database for storing and retrieving data about markers and users, also handles authentication. Uses Google Maps API for placing markers, displaying the map, handling on click events and other features. Gained more experience with networking and managing a database. Used event-driven programming patterns.</p>
		
		<h4>Endless simple video game (C#, Unity)
		<a href="https://juliuz.itch.io/cloud-slayer" class="icon fas fa-play-circle"><span class="label">Github</span></a>
		</h4>
		
		<p> Gained knowledge about event driven programming in C#, calculating rotations, speed, position and progression of game difficulty. Some of the GUI elements and mechanics were already implemented, learned to work with existing code base.</p>
